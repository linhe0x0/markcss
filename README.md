# markcss <sup><em> for Markdown</em></sup>

This is a markdown theme carefully crafted & designed for modern computer screens.

The theme now has a **built-in** dark mode support. Which means the theme changes with your system, and you don't have to manually setup any preferences.

Separated themes (`mark-light.css`, `mark-dark.css`) are also provided.

And separated themes (`github-markdown.css`, `github-markdown-light.css`, `github-markdown-dark.css`) for GitHub Markdown style are also provided.

This theme is currently tested on MacOS only.
